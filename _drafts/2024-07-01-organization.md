## Title Drafts
* From traditional IT department to Cloud Center of Excellence
## Intro
The challenges of moving your workload to Azure isn’t just technical. Many organizations that has started to work more with a cloud first strategy faces the challenges of who is going to be responsible of what and how can we unlock the speed and agility that the cloud promises without losing control or letting the organization come in the way?

The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) covers multiple areas regarding the cloud journey, and it’s a heavy read if you are going to try to read it all. My recommendation is to get a basic understanding of the CAF and use it as a reference or encyclopedia to guide you along the way, and take a deep dive into each part as you come closer to each specific challenge.

Recently I took a deep dive in how to mature an organization when moving to a cloud first strategy to ensure that you bring agility and autonomy to the teams utilizing the platform, but still don’t lose control or structure in your continued adoption of Azure.
## Overview
It's common to start small when adopting a cloud strategy, not moving everything at once to the cloud. Starting with one or a few teams that are interested and can help drive the adoption is good, we will call them Cloud Adoption Teams. But having them responsible for everything when it comes to the cloud is not the best idea. As a minimum we want to separate the team who are utilizing the cloud for their workload from the team that is responsible for cloud governance. So the minimum starting point would look something like this.
